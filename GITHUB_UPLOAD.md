# Uploading the Model Compression Pipeline to GitHub

This guide will walk you through the process of uploading this project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already at [github.com](https://github.com/).

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

Navigate to the project root directory and initialize a Git repository:

```bash
cd model_compression_pipeline
git init
```

## Step 2: Add Files to Git

Add all the project files to the repository:

```bash
git add .
```

## Step 3: Commit the Files

Create your first commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Model Compression Pipeline with pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation"
```

## Step 4: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "model-compression-pipeline")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose to make the repository public or private
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have those files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 5: Link Local Repository to GitHub

GitHub will display commands to push an existing repository. Run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/model-compression-pipeline.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 6: Verify the Upload

1. Go to your GitHub account and navigate to the new repository
2. You should see all your project files uploaded successfully
3. Check that the directory structure and files look correct

## Step 7: Add Additional Information (Optional)

1. Edit the repository description and add topics on GitHub
2. Set up GitHub Pages if you want to showcase the project
3. Connect the repository to other services like Zenodo for DOI generation if it's a research project

## Step 8: Managing Future Updates

For future updates to your code:

1. Make your changes locally
2. Add the changed files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication issues, you might need to use a personal access token instead of a password
- If you get merge conflicts, you'll need to resolve them before pushing
- For large files (>100MB), consider using Git LFS or excluding them from the repository

## Additional GitHub Features to Consider

- **Issues**: Track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks
- **Pull Requests**: Review and incorporate changes from collaborators
- **Actions**: Set up CI/CD workflows for automated testing
- **Projects**: Organize and prioritize work
- **Wiki**: Create documentation for your project

Congratulations! Your Model Compression Pipeline is now on GitHub and available for sharing with others.
